Synopsis
We used the Unreal Engine 4 as a development tool for our Virtual Reality exploration in Mars. We also used NASA’s database to obtain elements and basic information on Mars that we later added to our project like Mars' pressure, gravity, density, and atmosphere composition. We were able to create a project that instilled pride and satisfaction with our hard work and could facilitate an astronaut’s preparation for a travel to Mars or could easily offer the general public an educational tool on Mars in every aspect.
